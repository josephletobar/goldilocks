# Goldilocks

Goldilocks is a Department of Defense–sponsored project developed under the University of Central Florida’s **Entrepreneurship for Defense** program, in collaboration with SOUTHCOM, the Defense Innovation Unit, and a multidisciplinary student team. The project focuses on researching freshwater conservation in the Panama Canal.

This repository serves as the central hub for my contributions to the Goldilocks project. Linked below are tools for data analysis and interactive Unity simulations.

## Tools

### 1. Panama Canal Displacement Analysis
[**Panama Canal Data Repository**](https://github.com/jleto6/panama-canal-data)  
Research tool analyzing how ship displacement affects water efficiency in Panama Canal lock cycles. Includes calculations and visualizations demonstrating how smaller vessels lead to higher water waste and how batching improves efficiency.
