# Goldilocks

Goldilocks is a Department of Defsense sponsored project developed under University of Central Florida’s Entrepreneurship for Defense program, in collaboration with SOUTHCOM, Defense Innovation Unit, and a multidisciplinary student team, to research freshwater conservation in the Panama Canal.

This repository serves as the hub for my work related to the Goldilocks project. Linked below are tools for data analysis and interactive simulations in Unity with C#.

## Tools

1. **Panama Canal Displacement Analysis**  
   - [Panama Canal Data Repository](https://github.com/jleto6/panama-canal-data) - Research tool analyzing how ship displacement affects water efficiency in Panama Canal lock cycles. Includes calculations and visualizations showing how small vessels lead to increased water waste and how batching improves efficiency.

1. **Unity Simulation Tools**
   - [Canal Simulation Repository](https://github.com/jleto6/canal-sim)  
   - [Bladder Simulation Repository](https://github.com/jleto6/bladder-sim)
