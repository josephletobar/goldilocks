# Goldilocks

Goldilocks is a Department of Defense–sponsored project developed under the University of Central Florida’s **Entrepreneurship for Defense** program, in collaboration with SOUTHCOM, the Defense Innovation Unit, and a multidisciplinary student team. The project focuses on researching freshwater conservation in the Panama Canal.

This repository serves as the central hub for my contributions to the Goldilocks project. Linked below are tools for data analysis and interactive Unity simulations.

## Tools

### 1. Panama Canal Displacement Analysis
A Python tool that models freshwater efficiency in Panama Canal lock operations. It uses NumPy-based calculations to estimate displacement, water usage, and per-cycle costs for Panamax and Neopanamax transits, and includes a greedy scheduling algorithm that batches smaller ships into shared lock cycles. Results are visualized in Jupyter notebooks with Matplotlib charts, allowing quick comparison of water loss, savings, and efficiency under different operational strategies.

### 2. Bladder Simulation Tool
A Unity-based simulation that visualizes a bladder-inspired water retention concept.  
This tool was built in response to a request from a Department of Defense sponsor, who asked the team to explore the feasibility of a bladder-inspired mechanism for reducing freshwater loss in canal operations.

### 3. Canal Simulation Tool
A lightweight Unity simulation of the Panama Canal’s lock and lake system.  
It visually models ship movement, water flow, and elevation changes with simplified mechanics.  
The tool illustrates ship transit through locks, elevation shifts, and Gatun Lake’s role as a freshwater reservoir.  
It is designed for conceptual understanding rather than physical-scale accuracy, supporting stakeholder communication with a clear, high-level view of canal function.
